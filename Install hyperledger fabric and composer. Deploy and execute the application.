Aim: Install hyperledger fabric and composer. Deploy and execute the application. 
Program Steps:
The following are prerequisites for installing the required development tools:
 Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12
 Docker Engine: Version 17.03 or higher 
 Docker-Compose: Version 1.8 or higher 
 Node: 8.9 or higher (Note: version 9 is not supported) 
 npm: v5.x
 git: 2.9.x or higher  Python: 2.7.x
 A code editor of your choice, we recommend VSCode.

If installing Hyperledger Composer using Linux, the following points need to be kept in mind: 
 Login as a normal user, rather than root.  Do not use sudo su to root. 
 When installing prerequisites, use curl, then unzip using sudo.  Run prereqs-ubuntu.sh as a normal user. It may prompt for root password as some of its actions
are required to be run as root.  Do not use npm with sudo or su to root to use it. 
 Avoid installing node globally as root. Prerequisites
To download prerequisites for Hyperledger Fabric development, run following command –
| curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/prereqs-ubuntu.sh
This command will download and install -| docker-compose , docker-engine, npm, git, python etc  Give permissions — chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh
 Run Script — ./prereqs-ubuntu.sh (restart system after it)  Essential CLI tools — npm install -g composer-cli@0.20
Steps
1. Create a directory — mkdir multichain_network
3. Create genesis block and channeltx
4. Update CA keys in docker composer file
Open project in code editor. We have to change CA keys in “docker-compose-e2e-template.yaml” file, therefore navigate tothis file in vscode. Under services section we have two certificate authorities named “ca0” and “ca1”. For ca0 — go to command section under ca0 and find CA1_PRIVATE_KEY and replace it withprivate key –
This key can be found in –
For ca1 — goto command section under ca1 and find CA2_PRIVATE_KEY and replace it withprivate key – This key can be found in –
Steps of Starting Hyperledger Fabric
1. Open docker-compose-base.yaml file which is present in the bin folder and introduce
following changes. As shown in the figure below –
Change peer volume binding to (for all 4 peers)-
2. To start fabric, run the following command – The output of the above command is shown below –
3. After completing all these steps, you can run command – This will list all running containers regarding our network setup, in our case it will list 10containers.
Proposed network setup is complete, our network have -  One orderer  Two Organizations  Four peers (two peers on each organization)
 Couchdb for all peers
4. Creating channel
5. Joining first peer where channel is created —
6. For other peers, we have to first fetch the config of block from orderer
For Fetching –
For joining channel –
Install chainCode on every machine
Start chaincode on one machine
Conclusion
We learnt about installing Hyperledger Fabric development tools and Hyperledger Composer usingLinux. We also successfully deployed a Hyperledger Fabric network having one orderer, two
organizations and two peers in each organization.
